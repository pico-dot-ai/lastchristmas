# Decisions and Open Questions

## Resolved
- Challenge window: day after Thanksgiving → 23:59 Dec 24 for Whamageddon and LDBC.
- Whamageddon edge: only the original “Last Christmas” recording knocks you out.
- Custom challenges: allowed and browseable (feature-flagged).
- Group discovery: invite-only via link/QR; no public search.
- Notifications: in-app + web push when available; no email.
- Out evidence: text note only (no media uploads).
- Platform: mobile web + optional PWA; no required native shell.
- Location: capture optional coarse location per-out with consent; omit for users under 18.

## Open
- Compliance/privacy: any additional regional age/location constraints to satisfy?
- Pending auth reintroduction: confirm choice of magic link vs. passkeys flow and UI.
- CI/testing baseline: pick required checks and coverage expectations.
